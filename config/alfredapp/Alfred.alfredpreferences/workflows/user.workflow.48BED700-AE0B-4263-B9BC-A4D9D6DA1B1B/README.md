## Usage

Change the case of text on the keyboard with the keyword `case`. All six styles are previewed as Alfred results. Select one to copy it to the clipboard and paste into in the current application.

Optionally, any text typed after `case` will be changed instead of the clipboard.

To assign a global hotkey, view Change Case in Alfred's Workflow editor. Double-click Hotkey node and assign your preferred keys.
