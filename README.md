# My dotfiles

My dotfiles (with a little thievery from some other dotfiles :P).

## Requesites

- [Brew](https://brew.sh/)
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)
- [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)

## Bootstrap

```sh
$ brew install zsh-completions
$ brew install zsh-syntax-highlighting
$ ./bootstrap.sh
```

## Configuring iTerm2

* Preferences -> Profile -> Keys:
  * Change `Presets...` to ` Natural Text editing`
